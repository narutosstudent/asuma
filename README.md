A brainstorming app built with Solid.js.

I was inspired to building something like this after using https://miro.com/. There are many improvements that could be made, though, I'm quite happy with it.

This project in particular taught me dragging elements aroud, since I've never built that from scratch. Surprisingly, it was much easier than expected.
